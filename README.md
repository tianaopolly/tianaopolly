- 👋 Hi, I’m @tianaopolly
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, movie, keep fit, and Machester Unit
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on LeetCode, because I have no program for many years. The reason is that I change my job many years ago, so I have almost forgotten how to program. Then I decided to re-study the python and do some excersice on LeetCode.
- 💞️ Now I’m trying to build a family album website on a home private cloud, it would be deploy on a Synology NAS.
- 📫 My email is tianaopolly@hotmail.com
